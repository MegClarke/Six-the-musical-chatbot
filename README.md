## Overview

This repository is a collection of my AI and machine learning projects developed during my internship at GDPLabs. The projects are intended to showcase various skills and techniques in the field of AI/ML, including data exploration, model training, and deployment of models for practical applications.

### Kaggle Titanic Competition

This project involves exploring and attempting to solve the Kaggle Titanic competition. The goal is to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, class, etc. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using different machine learning algorithms.

### Six the Musical Chatbot

A simple chatbot project focused on "Six the Musical". The chatbot is designed to answer questions and provide information about the musical. This project involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques and chatbot development.

## Installation
